      <title>1.1 Why FRC0?</title>

      <description>FRC0 was created to help address the following issues:
There is a lot of information about FIRST Robotics Competition, but it is spread out across many different websites and sources. There are not as many Mentors and Coaches as there are students. Guides like WPIlib, Rev, CTRE, and others are great, but they are not always easy to understand or they don&amp;rsquo;t cover all the topics. For example, the WPIlib guides do not cover the game or the competition.</description>
