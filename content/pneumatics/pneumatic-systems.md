Setting up a pneumatic system can be a daunting task. This section will cover the basics of setting up a pneumatic system. It will cover the basics of the components and how to connect them. It will also cover the basics of how to setup the compressor and the PCM and how to test the system.

## Gatherings the Components

The first step in setting up a pneumatic system is to gather the components. The components are listed below:

- Compressor
- Pressure Switch
- Air Tank
- Solenoid
- Pneumatic Hose
- Fittings
- Release Valve
- Pressure Gauge
- Pressure Regulator

## Compressor

The air compressor is the heart of the pneumatic system. It is the device that compresses the air and stores it in the air tank. The compressor is connected to the PCM and the PCM controls the compressor. Compressors will automatically run unless the pressure switch is above the set pressure limit. The compressor can also be manually turned on and off from the robot code. The PCM and the compressor are connected with a 12V power cable. The red and black wire spots are marked on the PCM or Hub.
