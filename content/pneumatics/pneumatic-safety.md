Pneumatics are powerful and can be dangerous if not used properly. This section will cover the safety rules and guidelines for pneumatics. As is the case with all safety rules, they are not meant to be restrictive. They are meant to be guidelines to help keep you safe. If you have any questions about the safety rules, please ask your mentor or coach.

## Safety Rules

1. Never use compressed air to propel a projectile.
2. Never use compressed air to propel a person.
3. Always wear safety glasses when working with pneumatics.
4. Always check for humans and other objects in the path of the pistons, air, system, before turning on the compressor.
5. Never turn on the compressor WITHOUT the pressure switch connected.
6. Make sure that the release valve is open before turning on the compressor during initial setup.

## Potential Hazards

- Tank Shattering
- Compressor Overheating
- Solenoid Failure (Misfiring)
- PCM Failure (Lack of control or Pressure Feedback)
- Air Leak (This can force hoses to slip off fittings)
