The time when you get to grow. The time when you get to make friends. The time when you get to make memories. The time when you get to be a part of something bigger than yourself. The time when you get to be a part of FIRST Robotics Competition.\nF.I.R.S.T. is always, and will always be about more than the wins, losses and points on the field. It is about the people. It is about the students, mentors, parents, volunteers, and sponsors. It is about the teams. It is about the community. FRC and the other programs offered by F.I.R.S.T. have fostered the community behind this site. The experiences we have had at competitions have shaped us into the people we are today. We have made friends, learned lessons, and grown as people. We have made memories that will last a lifetime. We have been a part of something bigger than ourselves. We have been a part of a FIRST Robotics Competition.\nBelow is an outline of the topics that will be covered in this chapter.\nContents for this Chapter Order Page Title Time Estimate 1.

	"content": "2.0 Engineering Design Engineering design is the process of designing a product or system to meet a specific set of requirements. The design process is a series of steps that engineers follow to design a product. The number of steps varies depending on who you ask, but the main point is that its a cycle. The design process is a cycle because it is not a linear process. Engineers will go back and forth between the steps as they work on the design. The design process is also iterative. This means that the design will be improved over time.\nAn example diagram of the design process is shown above.\nBelow is an outline of the topics that will be covered in this chapter.\nContents for this Chapter Order Page Title Time Estimate 2.1 Design Process 30 minutes 2.2 Design Brief 30 minutes 2.3 Design Constraints 30 minutes 2.4 Design Specifications 30 minutes 2.5 Design Requirements 30 minutes 2.6 Design Sketches 30 minutes 2.7 Design Models 30 minutes 2.8 Design Testing 30 minutes 2.9 Design Review 30 minutes 2.10 Design Iteration 30 minutes 2.11 Design Documentation 30 minutes 2.12 Design Presentation 30 minutes Total 6 hours "

The language that you choose to use will depend on your team\u0026rsquo;s preferences and the programming language that your mentors are most comfortable with. The programming language that you choose to use will also depend on the programming language that your team\u0026rsquo;s robot controller is programmed in. The robot controller is the computer that controls the robot. The robot controller is a NI RoboRio. The Roborio can be configured for any of the languages listed above.\nRobot code is also not the only type of programming done in FRC. Teams write GUI software for their drive stations, they make games in Unity and Unreal Engine, and they write code for their websites. Students also learn how to write low level firmware for devices like arduinos and raspberry pis. Programming is a very important part of FRC and students can come into FRC with little to no programming experience and leave with a very strong understanding of programming. The guides here are intended to help in that process and also expose students to the different types of programming that are done in FRC.\nBelow is an outline of the topics that will be covered in this chapter.\nContents for this Chapter Order Page Title Time Estimate 6.1 Programming Languages 30 minutes 6.2 Java 30 minutes 6.3 C++ 30 minutes 6.4 LabVIEW 30 minutes 6.5 Python 30 minutes 6.6 Robot Code 30 minutes 6.7 Timed Robot 30 minutes 6.8 Command Based Programming 30 minutes 6.9 RobotBuilder 30 minutes 6.10 Path Planning 30 minutes 6.11 Robot Simulation 30 minutes 6.12 Vision Processing 30 minutes 6.13 ROS 30 minutes 6.14 GUI Programming 30 minutes 6.15 Unity 30 minutes 6.16 Unreal Engine 30 minutes 6.17 Web Development 30 minutes 6.18 Arduino 30 minutes 6.19 Raspberry Pi 30 minutes "

	"content": "Originally discovered by the ancient Greeks, pneumatics is the study of air pressure. Pneumatics is a branch of fluid power that uses compressed air to power actuators. Pneumatic actuators are used to move mechanical parts, such as valves, cylinders, and other devices. Pneumatic systems are used in a wide variety of applications, including robotics, manufacturing, and construction.\nIn FRC teams typically use cylinders to extend and retract a piston. This can be used to move a mechanism in a linear direction, or to rotate a mechanism. Cylinders are usually measured by the stroke length, bore diameter, and rod diameter. The stroke length is the distance the piston can travel in one direction. The bore diameter is the diameter of the cylinder. The rod diameter is the diameter of the piston. The bore and rod diameters are usually the same. They can also come in a large variety of sizes and styles.\nA typical pneumatic system in FRC can look something like this:\nImage courtesy of FRC 358\nBelow is a downloadable copy of FIRST\u0026rsquo;s pneumatics guide. This guide is a great resource for learning about pneumatics. It covers the latest hardware changes, and includes a lot of useful information.

The most common pneumatic components are shown in the table below:\nComponent Description Image Vendor Link(s) Solenoid A solenoid is a valve that uses an electric current to open and close. It is used to control the flow of air in a pneumatic system. Solenoids can be 12v or 24v. There is a jumper on the PCM for this! Andymark Double Solenoid A double solenoid is a valve that uses an electric current to open and close. It is used to control the flow of air in a pneumatic system. It has two ports, one for air in and one for air out. Solenoids of both kinds are usually attached to manifold Andymark Compressor A compressor is a device that uses an electric motor to compress air. It is used to provide the air pressure for a pneumatic system. Teams can prefill tanks with an offboard compressor board. It must still use the PCM as its controlling hardware. Andymark Pneumatic Cylinder A pneumatic cylinder is a device that uses compressed air to extend and retract a piston. These can come in a wide variety of sizes and shapes. Andymark Pneumatic Tank A pneumatic tank is a device that stores compressed air. They don\u0026rsquo;t all have to be plastic. There is not a limit on the capacity of your tanks, however they must be rated for higher than 125 PSI Andymark Pneumatic Fitting A pneumatic fitting is a device that connects two pneumatic components together. Fittings can come in many different styles. There are splitters, T taps, and more! Andymark Pneumatic Hose A pneumatic hose is a device that carries compressed air from one component to another. These can come in a variety of colors and styles. All of the ones for FRC are 1/4 inch in diameter. Andymark Pressure Release Valve A pressure release valve is a device that releases air pressure from a pneumatic system. There are several types of these used in FRC. There are levers, spring pulls and more. As long as it can safely vent air in a hurry! Andymark Pressure Switch A pressure switch is a device that detects when the air pressure in a pneumatic system is above or below a certain value. Andymark Pressure Gauge A pressure gauge is a device that displays the air pressure in a pneumatic system. Andymark Analog Pressure Sensor An analog pressure sensor is a device that converts the air pressure in a pneumatic system into an analog voltage. Andymark Pressure Regulator A pressure regulator is a device that controls the air pressure in a pneumatic system. Andymark Pneumatic Control Module A pneumatic control module is a device that controls the air pressure in a pneumatic system.

As is the case with all safety rules, they are not meant to be restrictive. They are meant to be guidelines to help keep you safe. If you have any questions about the safety rules, please ask your mentor or coach.\nSafety Rules Never use compressed air to propel a projectile. Never use compressed air to propel a person. Always wear safety glasses when working with pneumatics. Always check for humans and other objects in the path of the pistons, air, system, before turning on the compressor. Never turn on the compressor WITHOUT the pressure switch connected. Make sure that the release valve is open before turning on the compressor during initial setup.
